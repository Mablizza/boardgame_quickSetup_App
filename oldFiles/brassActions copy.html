                                any card from your Hand, the Build action requires an appropriate card be discarded face up onto your

                                </br>• If no undeveloped spaces display your industry’s icon, you may not place it in that location.

                                </br> c) If the last cube is moved from your Industry tile to its Market, flip the Industry tileQ and advance
